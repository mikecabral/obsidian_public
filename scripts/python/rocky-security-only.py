##### This script uses the dnf command to check for the package lists and then upgrade only the packages that are marked as security updates. The dnf check-update --security command lists the security updates available and the script passes the output of this command to the dnf update --security --advisory=RHSA-* command to upgrade only those packages. The --advisory=RHSA-* option specifies that only Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA) type updates should be considered.
